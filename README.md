Particle Magic: Hand-Tracking Galaxy

A mesmerizing, gesture-controlled particle simulation built with Three.js and MediaPipe Hands. This application allows users to manipulate thousands of stars in 3D space using only their hands, featuring custom shapes, neon bloom effects, and cloud-based sharing via Firebase.

✨ Features

Real-time Gesture Control:

👆 Pinch: Grab and move the particle system.

👐 Two-Hand Spread: Zoom in and out of the galaxy.

✊ Fist: Collapse the shape into a singular point.

🖐️ Open Palm: Trigger a supernova-style explosion.

Dynamic Shapes: Toggle between Galaxy Spirals, Quantum Spheres, DNA Helices, Torus Knots, and more.

Customizable Visuals: Adjustable color modes (Rainbow, Gradient, Solid), background themes, and Neon Bloom post-processing.

Save & Share: Generate unique links to save your current particle configuration to the cloud and share them with others.
